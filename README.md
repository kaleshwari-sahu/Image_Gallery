# Image Gallery

This is a simple and attractive image gallery website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases a collection of images categorized into different tabs for easy navigation.

## Features

### HTML

- **Semantic HTML structure:** Uses elements like `header`, `section`, `div` for better readability and SEO.
- **Image elements with structured data:** Each thumbnail image uses `data-*` attributes to store information about the larger image, description, and category.
- **Tab structure:** Utilizes buttons for tabs and `div` containers for tab content.

### CSS

- **Responsive design:**  Adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing experience.
- **Modern layout:**  Employs Flexbox for easy alignment and arrangement of elements.
- **Visually appealing design:**  Utilizes background image, shadows, hover effects, and transitions for an enhanced user interface.
- **Lightbox effect:**  Creates a modal window for viewing images in a larger size with descriptions.
